# JavaDoc Code Snippets Developer Guide

JavaDoc is crucial for Java developers to understand the features of different classes, interfaces, enums, and methods. While JavaDoc offers a platform to document the source code, adding code snippets to API documentation has been challenging. Java 18 introduces JEP 413 to tackle this problem. The new feature offers a user-friendly experience to add inline code snippets, and external source files can also be utilized.

Say goodbye to incorrect or outdated code snippets in JavaDoc! The new `@snippet` tag is an effective solution for including code snippets in the documentation. These improvements will facilitate better code quality, improve software development, and encourage more developers to use the Java API.
